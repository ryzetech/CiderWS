# About
Cider has a WebSocket API. Yes, I wouldn't have thought either! But, unlike the REST API, calling it "documentated" would be a blunt lie because documentation... doesn't exist. No worries tho! I had the absolute boredom to do some digging in the JavaScript code for the Web Remote and here we are. I just wrote this as a part of a cool VS Code extension... Oh well...

# Installation
